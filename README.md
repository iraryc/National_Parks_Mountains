<h1>National Parks & Mountain Website<h1>

<h6>Homepage<h6>
<p>On my homepage, I've designed a visually striking hero section featuring a large, captivating image to draw in visitors. For easy navigation, I've included a few select options in the body that provide quick access to the National Parks and Mountains pages, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly browsing experience. <p>

<h6>National Parks Page<h6>
<p>On the National Parks page, I've implemented two intuitive ways to explore parks: by location or by type. Users can click on their preferred option, which reveals a dropdown menu. Selecting a state or park type from the dropdown triggers the display of a card featuring the park's title. When users hover over the title, the card expands to show comprehensive information about the national park, enhancing the browsing experience.<p>

<h6>National Parks Page<h6>
<p>On the mountains page, I've implemented a large dropdown menu that lists all the mountain options. When you select a mountain from the dropdown, a card appears displaying a picture of the chosen mountain along with all its relevant information, providing users with a comprehensive and visually engaging experience.<p>

<h6>Book a Visit<h6>
<p>I also created an extra book a visit page where you can include all your information. <p>

<h6>Interesting Code<h6>
<p>A part of my code that I really enjoyed was creating my cards with an overlay on my homepage. <p>
